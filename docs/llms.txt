# SideKick PS

> SideKick PS is automation software for professional photographers that connects ProSelect photo sales software with GoHighLevel CRM.

## What It Does

SideKick PS eliminates manual data entry between ProSelect and GoHighLevel:

- **Invoice Sync**: One-click export from ProSelect creates a complete GHL invoice with all line items, payments, and contact sheet image
- **Client Import**: Pull client data from GHL into ProSelect instantly
- **Payment Calculator (Done For You)**: Auto-generate and enter payment plans into ProSelect — no typing, no mistakes, no forgetting
- **GoCardless Integration**: Set up Direct Debit payments during the sale so you never forget — available in UK, USA, EU, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
- **Xero/QuickBooks**: SKU matching for accounting software integration

## The Problem It Solves

Photographers often agree payment plans with clients but forget to set up the Direct Debit later. This leads to:
- Lost revenue
- Awkward chasing conversations
- Complicated accounting

With SideKick, you set up DD payments right there during the sale — before the client leaves. Payments are collected automatically.
