                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Zoom Photography Studios Ltd ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use SideKick PS software ("the Software"). By using the Software, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 License Information</h3>
                <p>When you activate a license, we collect only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your GoHighLevel Location ID (used as your license identifier)</li>
                    <li>License activation status and expiry date</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Payment Processing</h3>
                <p><strong>We have no access to your payment card details.</strong> All payments are processed securely by LemonSqueezy, our payment provider. Your card information is entered directly on LemonSqueezy's secure platform — we never see, store, or have access to your payment details.</p>

                <h3>2.3 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <p><strong>SideKick PS stores no personal data.</strong> The Software operates entirely locally on your computer. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name, address, or personal details</li>
                    <li>Your client data, contact information, or order details</li>
                    <li>Payment card numbers, bank details, or financial information</li>
                    <li>GoHighLevel API credentials or access tokens</li>
                    <li>GoCardless account credentials or payment data</li>
                    <li>Cardly API keys or greeting card content</li>
                    <li>ProSelect data or XML exports</li>
                    <li>Any data you enter into the Software</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.4 Local Data Storage</h3>
                <p>The Software stores only configuration settings (such as your preferences and API endpoints) locally on your computer in an INI file. No personal data is stored. This configuration data never leaves your machine and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The Software integrates with the following third-party services. Each service has its own privacy policy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LemonSqueezy:</strong> Handles all subscription billing and payment processing. Your payment card details are provided directly to LemonSqueezy — we never see or have access to this information.</li>
                    <li><strong>GoHighLevel:</strong> CRM data is accessed via your own API credentials and processed locally on your computer</li>
                    <li><strong>GoCardless:</strong> Direct Debit functionality connects directly to YOUR GoCardless account using credentials you provide. Customer payment data is transmitted directly from your computer to GoCardless — it never passes through our servers. You are the data controller for your customers' payment information. GoCardless acts as your payment processor, not ours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardly International:</strong> Greeting card functionality connects directly to YOUR Cardly account using an API key you provide. Image data and recipient addresses are transmitted directly from your computer to Cardly's servers for printing and postage — they never pass through our servers. You are responsible for ensuring recipient addresses and card content are correct. Cardly acts as your print and postal service provider, not ours.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies separately.</p>
                
                <h3>3.1 Your Compliance Responsibilities</h3>

                    <li>Handling customer disputes and refunds through your GoCardless dashboard</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">GoCardless handles DDR Service Agreements, payment notifications, and scheme compliance on your behalf. See <a href="https://gocardless.com/legal/merchants/" class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">GoCardless Merchant Terms</a> for details.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">When using Cardly through SideKick, you are the account holder and are responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complying with <a href="https://www.cardly.net/terms" class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Cardly Terms of Service</a></li>
                    <li>Ensuring recipient addresses are correct and that you have consent to send physical mail</li>
                    <li>The content of messages and images printed on greeting cards</li>
