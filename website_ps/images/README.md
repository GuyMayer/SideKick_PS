Screenshots needed for landing page
==================================

Replace these placeholder files with actual screenshots (PNG format, ~1920x1200 recommended).

1. hero-screenshot.png
   - ProSelect main window with SideKick toolbar visible on the title bar
   - Have an order/album open so it looks active
   
2. feature-invoice-sync.png
   - The invoice sync progress GUI mid-sync, OR
   - A completed GHL invoice showing line items and payment schedule

3. feature-payment-calc.png
   - The Payment Calculator filled in with a realistic payment plan
   - Show the downpayment section and scheduled payments

4. feature-client-import.png
   - ProSelect with client fields populated after a GHL import, OR
   - The client preview dialog showing fetched data

5. feature-room-capture.png
   - A room capture result - the saved JPG of a ProSelect room view, OR
   - The capture confirmation dialog

6. favicon.png
   - 32x32 or 64x64 SideKick logo for browser tab

Tips:
- Use ShareX (free) to capture and annotate
- Keep a consistent window size for all screenshots
- Dark theme looks best on the dark landing page
- Crop out any sensitive client data
